# SQL Projects

This repository contains multiple SQL projects demonstrating practical applications of SQL concepts in **employee and sales data analysis**. Each project is organized into separate `.sql` files for clarity.  

## Projects Included

1. **Views**  
   - Creating virtual tables to summarize employee and department data.  
   - Example: Department total sales.

2. **Stored Procedures**  
   - Dynamic queries using input parameters.  
   - Example: Fetch employee sales between a start and end date.

3. **Joins**  
   - Combining multiple tables (`Employees_`, `Sales_`, `Departments_`) for detailed analysis.  
   - Examples: Employee sales, department-wise performance.

4. **Set Operators**  
   - Using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` to compare datasets and merge results.

5. **Subqueries**  
   - Nested queries for filtering, comparison, and advanced calculations.  
   - Example: Employees earning above average or exceeding another employeeâ€™s sales.

6. **Aggregation**  
   - Using `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT` with `GROUP BY` to summarize data per employee or department.

7. **Window Functions**  
   - Using `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `SUM() OVER()` for running totals, rankings, and other advanced analytics.

8. **Indexes**  
   - Optimizing query performance on frequently accessed columns like `EmployeeID`.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the relevant `.sql` file in your SQL environment (SQL Server Management Studio or similar).  
3. Run the queries in sequence or as needed.  
4. Modify parameters in stored procedures or queries to match your dataset.

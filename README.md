# SQL Projects

This repository contains multiple SQL projects demonstrating practical applications of SQL concepts. Each project is organized into separate `.sql` files for clarity.  

## Projects Included

1. **Views**  
   - Creating virtual tables to summarize data.  
   - Example: Summarizing table information or metrics.

2. **Stored Procedures**  
   - Dynamic queries using input parameters.  
   - Example: Fetching data based on a date range or user input.

3. **Joins**  
   - Combining multiple tables for detailed analysis.  
   - Example: Merging data from different sources to generate insights.

4. **Set Operators**  
   - Using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` to compare datasets and merge results.

5. **Subqueries**  
   - Nested queries for filtering, comparison, and advanced calculations.  
   

6. **Aggregation**  
   - Using `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT` with `GROUP BY` to summarize data.

7. **Window Functions**  
   - Using `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `SUM() OVER()` for running totals, rankings, and other advanced analytics.

8. **Indexes**  
   - Optimizing query performance on frequently accessed columns.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the relevant `.sql` file in your SQL environment (SQL Server Management Studio or similar).  
3. Run the queries in sequence or as needed.  
4. Modify parameters in stored procedures or queries to match your dataset.
